2017-01-27 21:28:39	edwardk	fwiw the chronomorphism thing turns out to be fairly boring
2017-01-27 21:29:14	edwardk	g_hylo and knowing about how to build distributive laws or the more interesting style of adjoint folds is where its at.
2017-01-27 21:29:48	edwardk	all the other whatevermorphisms are variants on cata/ana/hylo just mangled by using a distributive law in a stylized manner.

2017-01-27 21:50:13	geekosaur	arch is better than most but that has its own sting in the tail: you build something with arch's library packages, then they upgrade them to a newer version and suddenly your stuff is breaking for no obvious reason

2017-01-27 21:52:25	glguy	But if you're using Arch, then the answer might not apply
2017-01-27 21:52:28	kadoban	That sounds quite limiting, as soon as you want to use something that's not in their package manager, which is going to be not very long ... I don't know how you'd even proceed without just switching to using cabal/stack.
2017-01-27 21:52:39	geekosaur	markasoftware, the general rule is if you use the distro's compiler package then use its libraries and not externally installed ones
2017-01-27 21:53:01	markasoftware	geekosaur: why is that?
2017-01-27 21:53:05	geekosaur	but this will limit you to what versions your distro offers, and trying to upgrade those will be painful

2017-01-27 21:58:18	geekosaur	another issue, relevant for gentoo (and other "ports" style distributions): if you install their ghc and then install libraries using cabal, then emerge-ing something else that uses ghc may potentially build with your library instead of gentoo's (*) and then they have a support nightmare on their hands if that breaks it
2017-01-27 21:58:21	markasoftware	well i guess ill take your advices and install with stack
2017-01-27 21:58:26	markasoftware	that's preferred over cabal now right?
2017-01-27 21:58:37	geekosaur	(*) granted, we strongly discourage global library installs so this shouldn't normally happen
