2017-01-27 23:38:33	Fausta	I mean just bc you move the world doesnt' mean you moved it in a good direction
2017-01-27 23:38:42	agd	there is some sense in what he says, but hes mostly an idiot
2017-01-27 23:38:44	vodkode	that fascinates me, the energy these people have, the creative drive
2017-01-27 23:38:54	vodkode	I wish I had 1/10th of that impetus
2017-01-27 23:38:59	dispersed	it's the social status that you get addicted to
2017-01-27 23:39:01	Ultreia	Very likely you do
2017-01-27 23:39:05	Ultreia	But everyone has a governor
2017-01-27 23:39:07	Fausta	yeah I mean HItler was a Great Man in the old sense
2017-01-27 23:39:19	Ultreia	Like the chip in a car that keeps it from going over 120 mph
2017-01-27 23:39:22	Fausta	just means you are moving the world, you might be really fucking it up badly
2017-01-27 23:39:25	agd	that the human is a spirit is something i agree on, that the soul is capable of boundless creativity is something i too agree on
2017-01-27 23:39:26	grublet	creative people are general mental
2017-01-27 23:39:32	agd	that all knowledge is within us is something i agree on too
2017-01-27 23:39:35	grublet	generally mental
2017-01-27 23:39:42	agd	but he makes a mockery out of these
2017-01-27 23:40:12	agd	actually after reading about hubbard, i finally understood why pythagoras and plato refused to teach their real doctrines publicly
2017-01-27 23:40:42	vodkode	why agd?
2017-01-27 23:40:46	Fausta	Pythagorus had some wild ideas
2017-01-27 23:40:47	Ultreia	Where did you read about their real doctrines?
2017-01-27 23:40:50	vodkode	whats your theory why they didn't
2017-01-27 23:40:56	Fausta	he thought that there was some twin to the Earth on the other side of the sun
2017-01-27 23:41:12	Ultreia	Ah
2017-01-27 23:41:21	dispersed	agd: the same idea with sufis in islam
2017-01-27 23:41:32	dispersed	agd: Sharia is taught to masses to keep 'em stupid

2017-01-27 23:42:02	dispersed	only "mystics" i.e. the sufis are free of it, and can think for themselves
2017-01-27 23:42:07	agd	hubbard was an idiot indeed, but he would be very important true for revolutionary thinkers of the future
2017-01-27 23:42:25	vodkode	he knew how to control people
2017-01-27 23:42:28	vodkode	bend them to his will
2017-01-27 23:42:29	agd	dispersed, the sufis themselves are stupid
2017-01-27 23:42:35	agd	dispersed: that is exactly what plato feared
2017-01-27 23:42:48	Fausta	vodkode: getting paid and getting laid
2017-01-27 23:42:55	Fausta	if you achieve these things -> not an idiot
2017-01-27 23:42:58	vodkode	hubbard was apparently a master hypnotist as well
2017-01-27 23:43:08	agd	dispersed: they think they're doing something better, when they really aren't
2017-01-27 23:43:41	<--	Millennial (~quassel@91.93.255.179) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2017-01-27 23:43:43	dispersed	I don't know what the sufis think because their stuff is a secret doctrine
2017-01-27 23:43:49	agd	dispersed: the sufis, and pretty much every other mystic, completely misunderstood these things

2017-01-27 23:56:22	Ultreia	It has happened in the last minute.
2017-01-27 23:56:29	Fausta	Ultreia: sarcasm is a typical way that intellectuals avoid "owning" their statements
2017-01-27 23:56:31	vodkode	Fausta imagine you 100% grok the universe, to put it simple. Well, now you have to grapple with the idea of OTHER universes, the idea that more than one IS possible and in an infinitum, probable, and if probable than an infinitum of them are probable
2017-01-27 23:56:39	vodkode	so its like a neverending staircase
2017-01-27 23:56:44	Fausta	Ultreia: I wasn't capable of making a single sincere statement until I was like 20
2017-01-27 23:56:53	Ultreia	Fausta: I make no judgement, I just wonder if he is really serious 24/7
2017-01-27 23:56:55	BloodFromBukhara	Ultreia, what does sarcasm have to do with anything
2017-01-27 23:56:59	BloodFromBukhara	Well
2017-01-27 23:57:01	BloodFromBukhara	I mean
2017-01-27 23:57:03	Ultreia	You said you were serious
2017-01-27 23:57:12	Ultreia	24/7
2017-01-27 23:57:20	BloodFromBukhara	I enjoy jokes, and usually laugh a lot tbh
2017-01-27 23:57:29	Ultreia	That is the opposite of what you said
2017-01-27 23:57:31	BloodFromBukhara	but mostly while watching a video or some shit

2017-01-27 23:57:37	BloodFromBukhara	You're right
2017-01-27 23:57:39	Ultreia	So perhaps you were being sardonic
2017-01-27 23:57:40	vodkode	I read a theory years ago that posited the notion that life originated in electromagnetism, neutrino space, the 'subtler' and chaotic realm of energy and frequency
2017-01-27 23:57:41	coolerthanu	fausta I think he might be right because math is derived empirically, so the rules of math have to be "out there" already. And the rules of it are derived logically because logic is the language of how things have to be
2017-01-27 23:57:44	BloodFromBukhara	I'm not depressed at all.
2017-01-27 23:57:48	BloodFromBukhara	sardonic?
