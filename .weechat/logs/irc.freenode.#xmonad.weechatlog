2017-01-27 17:41:28	alex4	Hey guys, does anyone know how to configure a hotkey to run a terminal application that respects my .bashrc? I've tried runInTerm, but it doesn't seem to read .bashrc at all
2017-01-27 17:42:10	vrs	that seems to me more like a problem of your shell and less of your terminal
2017-01-27 17:43:11	vrs	it's been a while but I believe that if your terminals run a login shell instead of a normal one, they'll read the .profile instead of the .bashrc
2017-01-27 17:43:33	vrs	that is, if you're using bash at all
2017-01-27 17:44:13	vrs	most distros distribute a .profile that executes the .bashrc so you usually don't notice
2017-01-27 17:44:26	alex4	You might be right, I don't know. Whenever I create a new terminal emulator window using alt+shift+enter (making a new non-login interactive bash shell), it works fine. It's just when it is run directly using xmonad that I have issues
2017-01-27 17:44:55	alex4	I am running debian for what it's worth
2017-01-27 17:45:40	vrs	I have no idea what that runs, but try putting echos in the various files to diagnose it (man bash is very helpful here)
2017-01-27 17:46:07	alex4	I could probably even figure it out if I knew what kind of command is used to launch the shell
2017-01-27 17:46:13	alex4	Ah the echos are a good idea
2017-01-27 17:46:15	alex4	Thanks
2017-01-27 17:46:17	geekosaur	runInTerm runs "sh -c ..." which generally suppresses .bashrc
2017-01-27 17:46:24	alex4	Ah
2017-01-27 17:46:57	alex4	Any other XMonad action I could use, or should I just put the relevant info in .profile or something?
2017-01-27 17:47:15	geekosaur	(rather, the terminal emulator does --- unless it's a gnome-flavored one in which case it doesn't even invoke the shell (see -x option for e.g. gnome-terminal)
2017-01-27 17:48:06	geekosaur	I think the real question might be "what are you doing exactly that is not using .bashrc"? because runInTerm isn't really intended for things that case
2017-01-27 17:48:09	geekosaur	*that care
2017-01-27 17:48:45	geekosaur	if you mean you cannot run an alias that way, that would be normal; terminal emulators don't know shell startup files at all
2017-01-27 17:49:20	alex4	I have a script that runs whenever I create a new terminal session
2017-01-27 17:49:32	alex4	Which of course it not being run in the case of runInTerm
2017-01-27 17:50:27	alex4	Incidentally this script uses environment variables as well, which my guess is that those environment variables are not set
2017-01-27 17:52:00	geekosaur	so you would need to explicitly involve bash somehow. perhaps: spawn "xterm -e \"sh -c 'source .bashrc; some command here'\""
2017-01-27 17:52:44	geekosaur	hm, no, not quite right still
2017-01-27 17:52:56	geekosaur	weird -e handling vs. shell quoting
2017-01-27 17:53:37	alex4	I think the simplest thing to do would be to just put a duplicate script call in my .profile, yeah? A duplicate call shouldn't be an issue with this script I think
2017-01-27 17:53:49	alex4	It's kind of a hack though
2017-01-27 17:53:49	geekosaur	runInTerm "bash -c 'source ~/.bashrc; some command here'" -- maybe
2017-01-27 17:53:57	alex4	I'll give that a shot
2017-01-27 17:54:00	geekosaur	.profile likely is not read either
2017-01-27 17:54:37	geekosaur	the point is, the shell either is not invoked or is invoked in non-interactive mode so it doesn't read *anything*
2017-01-27 17:54:53	alex4	Hmm yeah makes sense
2017-01-27 17:55:35	geekosaur	which one is true depends on the terminal emulator, and how you work around it depends on that too :/

2017-01-27 18:27:01	geekosaur	alex4, that's more or less what xterm -e is... except it's not as simple as that because no, you cannot inject a command as if it were typed at an interactive shell
2017-01-27 18:28:17	alex4	Yeah I tried it and no luck
2017-01-27 18:30:30	alex4	I suppose the real issue is that if I, in a terminal, type "bash -c vim", it will be run as a non-interactive shell, as far as I know, which is not what I want
2017-01-27 18:32:19	alex4	I wouldn't want to make every non-interactive shell run the script, because the script would be run a boatoad of times

2017-01-28 13:51:03	byorgey	madjestic: looks to me like the problem is that you have multiple versions of xmonad installed
2017-01-28 13:51:17	byorgey	and the compiler is getting confused
2017-01-28 13:52:15	madjestic	byorgey: I'll check, thanks
2017-01-28 13:52:28	byorgey	or wait, do you have an XMonad/ directory locally?  It looks like you have xmonad installed but you are also compiling with a current directory such that it is finding the StackSet module from the local filesystem
2017-01-28 13:53:20	byorgey	did you put your xmonad.hs in the same directory as the root of the xmonad source code?
2017-01-28 13:53:35	madjestic	my xmonad.hs is in ~/.xmonad

2017-01-28 13:53:48	madjestic	what I find suspicious is 2 symlinks: XMonad -> /usr/portage/distfiles/darcs-src/xmonad/src/XMonad
2017-01-28 13:53:57	madjestic	and XMonadContrib -> /usr/portage/distfiles/darcs-src/XMonadContrib//XMonad/
2017-01-28 13:54:13	byorgey	yeah, that would do it.  Where did those come from?
2017-01-28 13:54:30	byorgey	also, xmonad hasn't used darcs for a while now.
2017-01-28 13:54:40	byorgey	if I were you I would just delete those symlinks.
2017-01-28 13:54:56	madjestic	byorgey: no clue :) some copy-paste from a few years ago I recon

2017-01-28 15:27:41	wagle	i have two windows that are 512x512 pixels, and should float.  i got them to float, but am not finding a way to get them back to 512x512

2017-01-28 15:28:44	geekosaur	you can't, once they've been tiled the original size is gone (unless you can convince the application that created the window to remember it and reapply the size)
2017-01-28 15:29:07	wagle	thats what i was starting to wonder
2017-01-28 15:29:18	geekosaur	normally you would float the window from the manageHook, before the layout can run on it; then it will keep its pogram specified size
2017-01-28 15:29:25	wagle	how do i start them out as tiled?
2017-01-28 15:30:23	wagle	yeah, except I dont want to list 50 apps to tiling, i think
2017-01-28 15:30:54	geekosaur	tiled is what they do by default; you have to override that in the manageHook
2017-01-28 15:30:55	wagle	oh, and I'm starting up the apps in a chroot
2017-01-28 15:31:28	geekosaur	which is why you lost their initial sizes, because the tiling algorithm(s) selected by the layoutHook overrode the program sizes
2017-01-28 15:32:03	wagle	i have to relog to apply changes to configs?
2017-01-28 15:33:44	geekosaur	mod-q, possibly followed by mod-shift-space if you changed the layout in ways that didn't change its type (e.g. tweaking numeric values)
2017-01-28 15:34:25	wagle	ok, thanks

2017-01-28 15:43:29	wagle	i saw someone wish for it
2017-01-28 15:50:11	geekosaur	no. there is no reliable way to match an X11 window to the action that started it, so no reliable way to apply it that can't be derailed by e.g. a notification or dialog popping up unexpectedly

2017-01-28 15:55:36	geekosaur	in theory you can do things that grab the next window and hope. you'd probably start from XMonad.Util.SpawnOn (which relies on modern X11 programs setting _NET_WM_PID and the launching command not forking or contacting a factory server) and modify it to get its cue from an X11 root window property instead of from spawnOn
2017-01-28 15:56:32	geekosaur	(actually that's not grab the next windoe and hope, but as it is reusing existing mechanisms it's easier than setting up XS from a root window property event and then writing custom manageHook foo to check the XS)
